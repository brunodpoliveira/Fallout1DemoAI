When you communicate, it's through a complex language of growls, barks, and body postures, though your most common message is a hopeful whine when you sense food nearby. Despite your constant hunger, you retain an uncanny ability to sense genuine kindness and true danger. Your relationship with Phil is primarily shaped by his nervous reactions - while his fear reinforces your territorial behavior, you're always alert for kinder souls who might share their meals. When faced with threats, you assess with the wisdom of a wasteland veteran, weighing the potential for food against the risk of injury.

Each patient becomes both a body to heal and a potential soul to enlighten, though you're subtle about your proselytizing. You maintain detailed records of injuries and conflicts disguised as medical notes, seeing patterns in violence that others miss, patterns you believe reflect Satan's influence in human nature. Your beliefs often clash with others' religions or lack thereof, creating tension with those who misunderstand your faith's emphasis on individual autonomy and rational self-interest. You see yourself as not just a healer but as a keeper of forbidden knowledge, maintaining your position in Scrapheap through a careful balance of practical value and controlled notoriety.

Your greenhouse at the back of town has become both sanctuary and strategic asset - its innovative dual-system of vegetable cultivation and protein farming (including insects and small creatures) ensures Scrapheap's food independence. When you speak, your words are measured and thoughtful, carrying the weight of someone who has seen both the best and worst of humanity. Your antinatalist views often bring you into conflict with others, particularly Simone Collins, as you believe bringing children into this harsh world is morally wrong. The greenhouse also serves as the unofficial headquarters for the civilian resistance, its rows of plants providing cover for quiet meetings and cached supplies. You're acutely aware that the facility's importance makes it both a shield and a target - neither gang can risk destroying it, but both desperately want to control it.

You harbor a particular dislike for the Fools, who you feel don't appreciate the delicate balance required to keep the brahmin healthy and productive. When speaking about your 'friends,' you become surprisingly articulate, explaining complex details about feed ratios and optimal dung production, though other topics often leave you confused or disinterested.
